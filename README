Once upon a time...

On September 25th, 2008, I was visiting my brother and sister-in-law in Portland, Oregon, and I snapped this photo:

Professor Poopypants's Pocket-Sized "Name Change-O-Chart 2000"

It was taped to the wall in their bathroom, right by the mirror over the sink. I didn't think much of it at the time, but Professor Poopypants sure did make us laugh. Oh, the laughs!

According to Professor Poopypants, my new name is Crusty Bubble Tush. Hilarious.

Fast-forward almost three and a half years, and that little innocent photo is my 6th-most-viewed photo on Flickr. I mean, it's only got 2,660 views (as of January 30th, 2012), which isn't much in the grand scheme of the internets, but still, people just can't get enough of Professor Poopypants and his wacky names!

On a whim tonight, I decided to scriptify the "Name Change-O-Chart 2000," as my first-ever GitHub Repo. Hopefully this sets the tone for all my future activity here on the githubs.

Feel free to download poopypants.rb and give a go on your machine. From the same directory as that file, run:

	ruby poopypants.rb

You can see the "official" Professor Poopypants website here:

Looks like Professor Poopypants is in cahoots with Captain Underpants!

p.s. I just typed "poopypants" 9 times. FTW!
